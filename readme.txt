Vase Maker (Spiky version)

First test of a 'vase maker' application for 3d printing. May be buggy but it works decently.

Export only OBJ files, you may need to convert to STL/3MF or the format you use for slicing/printing.

No instalation required, just unzip the files and run the VM_SPIKY application.

Versions: Windows (32/64 bits)
 * win32_nojava & win64_nojava requires Java-8 to be installed in your computer
 * win64 : Includes that Java thing so no need to install anything else.
